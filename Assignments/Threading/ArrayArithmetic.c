        In the for loop below, we utilize the thread id to divide the size
        of the arrays into equal sections. By doing this, when the threads
        run in parallel, they are not accessing the same index of the array
        but rather "working on their section" of the array.

        Ex: Thread ID #1 passed in
            i = 0 (Thread ID int value) * Array Size / 4 = 0
            i < (thread ID 0 + 1) = 1 * (1,000,000 / # of Threads 4) = i < 1 * 250,000
            i++

            Therefore this example will loop from 0 to 250,000 indexes in the array
