# Assignment #1 - POSIX Fork
## Problem.
You just got a job in a software development company that sells any product that a client
may be interested to have. Your first assignment is to develop a small C program which
will run in a UNIX multiprocessor system. This machine has exactly 3 processors and your
program is supposed to read two integer values A and B and compute 3 different results:
A*B, A-B, and A+B. It is obvious that if you have 3 processes running, you can execute
all those 3 operations in parallel. Your mission is to write THE program (only one program)
that “forks” two other processes in order to do all 3 operations simultaneously and display
the results in the screen. You will hand in the printout of your source code on the due date
(no late work will be accepted) or submit through D2L. Check the sequence of the
instructions in your program and the order of appearance of the results in the screen and
briefly (very briefly) explain any discrepancy (use comments in the source code). Use
CYGWIN to run and verify your code or any other Unix-like system you may have access
to.
